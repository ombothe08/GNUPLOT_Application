# GNUPLOT_Application
# Console Shape Application Project
 
This C++ project is designed to handle geometric shapes, including Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle. The project follows a modular structure with separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for each class.
 
## Folder Structure
 
The project is organized into the following folders:
 
 
- **include**: Contains header files for each geometric shape class.

- **src**: Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.

- **main.cpp**: Main source file where the program execution starts.
 
##  1. Rectangle

- Header: include/Rectangle.h

- Implementation: src/Rectangle.cpp

## 2. Triangle

Header: include/Triangle.h

Implementation: src/Triangle.cpp

## 3. Circle

Header: include/Circle.h

Implementation: src/Circle.cpp
 
 
## Building and Running
 
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

## Building and Running
 
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/ombothe08/Console_Application.git

##  Input :
1. We provide the text file path to the gnu application.
2. Text file is created automatically as we have done changes in .vscode/tasks.json as set the text file creation.

##  Output :
1. For the output we copy the text file path from folder which contain coordinates.
2. we run that text file using command plot "file path" w lp
